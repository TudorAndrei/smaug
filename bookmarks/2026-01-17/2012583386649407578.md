> Have you been in a situation where using Kubernetes would be overkill, but deploying to a bunch of VMs with bespoke scripts or Ansible playbooks doesn't sound like fun either?

Docker Swarm may or may not be dead, but the niche does exist, and projects like Kamal (by 37signals) and Uncloud (by Pasha Sviderski) are trying to cover it.

If you haven't heard of the latter, Uncloud is a lightweight (compared to Kubernetes) tool for deploying and managing containerised applications across a network of Docker hosts.

Anton Ovchinnikov​ recently published a ​step-by-step guide on iximiuz Labs​ showing how to set up an Uncloud cluster on a few VMs. Check it out: https://t.co/7ukY6fUmxa

Traditionally, you can try all the commands from the tutorial right in the attached playground.
