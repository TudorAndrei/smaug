> The most transferable skill you can acquire is learning how to climb skill trees -- especially ones that are brutally hierarchical.

This meta-skill is abstract, but you acquire it by practicing on particulars. You gotta lean into specific domains and acquire measurable, demonstrable skills.

But once you see it, once you get a feeling for the process, you see it everywhere.
