# @oprydai

> you need four hobbies. no more, no less.

create
bring something into existence. write, build, draw, code, cook. creation grounds you. it turns thought into reality.

consume
read books. watch films. study art. this feeds taste and perspective. good input sharpens good output.

cavort
move your body daily. walk, lift, run, dance. motion stabilizes the mind. a stagnant body distorts thinking.

commune
have a community. friends, family, peers. isolation corrodes judgment. shared reality keeps you sane.

miss one, and the system degrades.
keep all four, and life stays balanced, generative, and human.
