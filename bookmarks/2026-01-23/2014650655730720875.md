> It's happened to every software engineer: you implement a feature, ship it to production, and everything works great.

Then, a few weeks later, you get different requirements. You have to support a new use case, but you find that your code isn't ready.

You look at the source code and see you need to change a lot of classes and method signatures, and you hope you don't break anything in the process.

What should have been a simple extension turns into a risky refactoring project. 

Here is where sound software design principles really make a difference:

- The Open-Closed Principle states that code should be "open for extension, closed for modification. Its goal is to write code that doesn't need changes when requirements evolve.

- Dependency Injection is an excellent technique for reducing coupling and promoting the open-closed principle. Instead of having the class create its own dependencies, it provides references to the things the class needs.

- Inversion of Control is a design pattern that removes responsibilities from a class, making it more straightforward and less tightly coupled to the rest of the system.

You can read a detailed breakdown of these 3 principles in the latest issue of @EngPolymathic

*Quoting @EngPolymathic:*
> The 157th issue of the Polymathic Engineer is out.

This week, we discuss 3 important software design principles and see how they relate to each other:

- Open-Closed Principle
- Dependency Injection
- Inversion of Control
