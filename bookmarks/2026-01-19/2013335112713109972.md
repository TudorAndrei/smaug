> I’ve figured out a new way of working that’s unlocked my speed of iteration massively.

Here’s how it works:

I have a simple cron job that runs every night at midnight. 

It gathers information from my database on user activity, marketing stats, and a couple other data points that are important. 

It then feeds that data into Opus 4.5 and asks for one important action item that I should take based on this data, and then emails me.

It also creates a markdown file with the recommendation, which is then stored in my reports folder in the GitHub repo. (This means I can fire up Amp anytime and chat either all of the historical recommendations whenever I want - learning about patterns.)

I then look at this email every morning and decide whether or not to take action on it. 

Almost every time it surfaces something really valuable for me to iterate. 

So I just open Amp, tell it to action idea, and then ship it.

Obviously, the next iteration of this is just to have Amp autonomously implement the suggestion by itself, and then I'll wake up to a PR instead of an email. 

Right now, though, I like the Human-In-The-Loop version of this.

And as soon as we iterate enough like that, I'll probably just set it up to automatically take the suggestion, create the PR, and then I'll have a look at it.

Obviously, you can take this loop even further by having many parts of your business evaluated this way. 

What's interesting to me is that this is what I used to rely on my VP of Marketing, my VP of Engineering, or my VP of Sales to do, but it happens automatically for about $0.15 per day.
