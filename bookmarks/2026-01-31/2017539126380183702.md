# @pixperk

> chug is one of my favorite projects by me.

a streaming etl pipeline that moves data from postgresql to clickhouse. streamed  ~30M rows in under 4 minutes at 145k rows/sec with constant memory. cdc keeps analytics fresh without full reloads. single go binary + clean web ui.

web ui still wip.
