Pullbase is an open-source GitOps tool that brings declarative infrastructure management to traditional Linux servers. It treats each server as a Git-managed resource, enabling teams to manage server configuration using the same Git workflows as code.

## Key Features

- Pull-based Go agent for continuous reconciliation
- Declarative YAML configuration files
- Automatic drift detection and auto-reconciliation
- Intuitive web dashboard
- Completely open-source
- Designed for teams of any size
- Alternative to Docker Swarm and lighter than Kubernetes
