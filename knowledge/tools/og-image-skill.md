An Agent Skill that generates social media preview images (Open Graph) by analyzing your codebase and design system to create optimal meta tags for sharing across Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, Discord, and more. Rather than relying on image generation models, this skill explores your actual design system and generates OG images in code, resulting in better design system matching.
